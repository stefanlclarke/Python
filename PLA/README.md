the function iteratePLA(D, Q, W, error) takes a set of data in however many dimensions D, where each D[i] has result Q[i] which should be plus or minus one.
The output vector [m1, m2, ... mn] are the coefficients in the data separating line m1*x1 + m2*x2 + ... + mn-1*xn-1 + mn == 0 which aims to separate the data points which are +1 from the points which are -1.
This is the perceptron learning algorithm.
