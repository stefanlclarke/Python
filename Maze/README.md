Generates a random maze with the function A = makemaze() on a 5x5 grid, displays it using a pygame window, then finds the optimal path to the finish (green square) using the Bellman equation. Areas from which you can't escape to the finish are coloured in red while in other areas the arrows should point you in the direction of the optimal path. (you need the png files for this to work!)
mazeexample.jpeg is an example of how the screen will look if the maze is solveable. The iterations number is the number of iterations until all correct arrows are in place, NOT the number of iterations until the true value function is found.
