In the notebook you will find a neural network written using numpy (and pyplot for plotting) which takes 3D data in the form [x, y, z] and tries to predict future z from x and y.
If you are curious about neural networks I would recommend this lecture as a beginners guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih5Mr93E-2c&t=3251s

Requirements to run are numpy and matplotlib
